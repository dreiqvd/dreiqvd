Hi! I am Drei.

A cat-dad of three, I'm a full stack developer with 5+ years of experience in coding, testing, and product development life cycle.

I'm also a self-taught designer with a passion for making modern and intuitive interfaces and effects.
I'm proficient in **Angular and Node** but is always up to the challenge to learn new tools and technologies.
